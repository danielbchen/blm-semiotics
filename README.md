# Understanding #BLM Through a Peircean Framework

This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook analyzing the hashtag #BLM on Twitter for Dr. Jonathan Clindaniel's course entitled Computation and the Identification of Cultural Patterns (Winter 2021) at the University of Chicago's Computational Social Science department. 

The bridges computational techniques through natural language processing and social science theory to understand how, and perhaps why, Twitter discourse around the hashtag #BLM has changed from 2016 to 2020.

Data for the project was obtained through [arXiv](), an open source repository of electronic pre-prints owned by Cornell University. The actual file only contains tweet IDs to abide by Twitter's user policy. I turned to [hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) to "hydrate" the tweet IDs into a .csv file containing the text of the tweet alongside its metadata. The analysis reveals how the content of #BLM tweets primarily focused on policy brutality in 2016 and evolved to encapsulate other forms of racism.
